## Syntax Meets Semantics: Understanding Scientific Formula

Scientific formulae are a core component of scholarly knowledge, yet their dual nature -- as **structured syntax** (e.g., symbols, operators, functions) and carriers of **semantic meaning** -- remains underexplored in scholarly information retrieval. 
A comprehensive understanding of scientific formula therefore requires modeling both modalities. 

We ask two key questions: 

(1) Do syntactic and semantic modalities of scientific formula _naturally_ align? 

(2) (_if misalignment exists_) Can a learned joint latent space better reconcile syntactic with semantic representation?
